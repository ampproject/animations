A demo of an inline expansion of an image using `prepareImageAnimation`. This
demo uses various value for `object-position` to show how you can position the
rendered images and how they look when animated.

Note: the animation can be very janky if the bottom of the body is visible
during a collapse animation in Chrome. This is due to scroll anchoring
behavior in Chrome changing the scroll position during the animation.
